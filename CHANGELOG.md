## [v25.1.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added — AI-Powered Features (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash)

- **Ask JanVayu (AI)**: Natural language Q&A interface grounded in live WAQI data
  - Supports questions in English and Hindi; responds in the user's language
  - Covers 40+ Indian cities with real-time AQI data
  - Concise, data-grounded responses (under 150 words)
  - Endpoint: `POST /.netlify/functions/air-query`

- **AI Health Advisory**: Personalised health guidance based on user profile and live PM2.5 levels
  - Considers age, pre-existing health conditions, and daily hours spent outdoors
  - Colour-coded risk levels: low / moderate / high / severe
  - Evaluates against WHO guideline (5 µg/m³) and user-specific risk factors
  - Provides concrete, actionable recommendations (e.g., "stay indoors until 2 pm")
  - Endpoint: `POST /.netlify/functions/health-advisory`

- **Ward-Level Accountability Brief (AI)**: Structured briefs for local governance and civic action
  - Target audiences: ward councillors, journalists, and resident welfare associations
  - Includes seasonal baselines from CREA/IQAir data with anomaly detection (1.5× threshold)
  - References GRAP stages, RTI powers, and MCD complaint lines for actionable next steps
  - Downloadable as `.txt` files for offline sharing
  - Endpoint: `POST /.netlify/functions/accountability-brief`

- **Anomaly Detection Banner**: Automatic PM2.5 spike monitoring across 5 major metros
  - Monitors Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, and Bengaluru
  - Runs on page load and refreshes every 30 minutes
  - Triggers at 2× seasonal baseline with one-sentence, month-aware AI explanations (e.g., stubble burning context in Oct–Mar)
  - Dismissible, expandable banner UI for multiple simultaneous alerts
  - 10-minute response caching for performance
  - Endpoint: `GET /.netlify/functions/anomaly-check`

### Added — Infrastructure

- **Demo Day mode**: `?demo=true` URL parameter pre-populates all AI features with Delhi/Anand Vihar defaults and shows a "DEMO MODE" badge
- 4 new Netlify Functions: `air-query.mjs`, `health-advisory.mjs`, `accountability-brief.mjs`, `anomaly-check.mjs`
- `.env.example` file with all required environment variables including `GEMINI_API_KEY`

### Changed
- Added `@google/generative-ai` SDK dependency (`^0.24.1`)
- Updated navigation: "Ask JanVayu (AI)" under Tools, "Accountability Brief (AI)" under Accountability
- Health Impact panel now includes AI Health Advisory subsection

### Technical Notes
- All Gemini API calls route through Netlify Functions — API keys are never exposed client-side
- Free tier rate limits: 250 requests/day, 10 requests/minute — fallback always returns raw PM2.5 data so users are never left without information
- Seasonal baselines sourced from CREA/IQAir data (1.5× threshold triggers accountability briefs, 2× triggers anomaly banner)
- Maximum output tokens capped at 400 for accountability briefs to keep responses focused
